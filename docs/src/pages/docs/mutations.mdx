# Mutations

Unlike queries, mutations in GraphQL are used to create, update or delete data.
For this purpose, Draqula offers `useMutation` hook.
Just like queries, remember to define your GraphQL queries **outside** your components to prevent infinite unnecessary rerenders.

## Basic mutations

Assuming server implements a `ping` mutation, that simply returns `"pong"` string, here's an example of the most basic mutation:

```jsx
const PING_MUTATION = gql`
	mutation {
		ping
	}
`;

const PingPong = () => {
	const {mutate} = useMutation(PING_MUTATION);

	const onPing = async () => {
		const data = await mutate();
		// {
		//   ping: 'pong'
		// }
	};

	return <button onClick={onPing}>Ping</button>;
};
```

Mutations without variables are not that useful, so let's add some variables to closer match the reality.

## Variables

Similar to `useQuery`, `useMutation` also accepts variables.
The only difference is that you don't pass them to `useMutation` itself, but to the `mutate` function that it returns.

```jsx
const CREATE_TODO_MUTATION = gql`
	mutation CreateTodo($title: String!) {
		createTodo(title: $title) {
			id
			title
		}
	}
`;

const CreateTodo = () => {
	const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
	const {mutate} = useMutation(CREATE_TODO_MUTATION);

	const onCreateTodo = async event => {
		// Prevent form from refreshing the page
		event.preventDefault();

		try {
			await mutate({title});

			// Todo was successfully created
		} catch (error) {
			// Uh oh, something went wrong
		}
	};

	return (
		<form onSubmit={onCreateTodo}>
			<input type="text" value={title} onChange={event => setTitle(event.target.value)} />
			<br />
			<button type="submit">Create Todo</button>
		</form>
	);
};
```

## Caching

When mutation succeeds, Draqula scans GraphQL types returned from that mutation and refetches all queries that use any of these types.
For example, let's say we have the following GraphQL schema on our server:

```gql
type Query {
	posts: [Post!]!
	pages: [Page!]!
}

type Mutation {
	createPost(title: String!): Post!
}

type Post {
	title: String!
}

type Page {
	title: String!
}
```

Imagine we also have the following code for our page:

```jsx
const POSTS_QUERY = gql`
	query {
		posts {
			title
		}
	}
`;

const PAGES_QUERY = gql`
	query {
		pages {
			title
		}
	}
`;

const CREATE_POST_MUTATION = gql`
	mutation CreatePost($title: String!) {
		createPost(title: $title) {
			title
		}
	}
`;

const Blog = () => {
	const {data: posts} = useQuery(POSTS_QUERY);
	const {data: pages} = useQuery(PAGES_QUERY);
	const {mutate: createPost} = useMutation(CREATE_POST_MUTATION);

	return (
		<>
			{/* ... */}
			<button onClick={() => createPost({title: 'Stranger Things'})}>Create Post</button>
		</>
	);
};
```

If user clicks "Create Post" button, `createPost` mutation will be executed, which returns only `Post` type.
That tells Draqula to find all queries that contain `Post` type and refetch them.
In that case, `POSTS_QUERY` is the only one that uses this type, so it will be refetched, while `PAGES_QUERY` will remain in the same state.

## Refetch queries

However, sometimes server uses the same data source, but returns it under various types.
In that case, Draqula has no way to know that some query uses the same data under the hood and we need to help it find those queries to refetch.
This is where `refetchQueries` option comes in.
It's a list of queries to refetch in addition to the ones Draqula finds by itself.

So if in theory, `PAGES_QUERY` needed to be refetched after `createPost` mutation, this is how it would work:

```js
const Blog = () => {
	const {data: posts} = useQuery(POSTS_QUERY);
	const {data: pages} = useQuery(PAGES_QUERY);
	const {mutate: createPost} = useMutation(CREATE_POST_MUTATION, {
		refetchQueries: [PAGES_QUERY]
	});

	// ...
};
```

It's important to mention that by default `createPost` doesn't wait for queries to finish refetching.
If this behavior is important for you, you can opt in for that via `waitForRefetchQueries` option:

```js
const Blog = () => {
	const {data: posts} = useQuery(POSTS_QUERY);
	const {data: pages} = useQuery(PAGES_QUERY);
	const {mutate: createPost} = useMutation(CREATE_POST_MUTATION, {
		refetchQueries: [PAGES_QUERY]
	});

	const onCreatePost = async () => {
		try {
			await createPost({title: 'Stranger Things'});

			// Both POSTS_QUERY and PAGES_QUERY are refetched at this point
		} catch (error) {
			// ...
		}
	};

	// ...
};
```

## API

### useMutation(query, options)

This hook returns [`MutationResult`](/docs/mutations#mutation-result) object.

#### query

Type: `DocumentNode`

Parsed GraphQL query via `gql` function from [`graphql-tag`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) module.
For example:

```js
const PING_MUTATION = gql`
	mutation {
		ping
	}
`;
```

#### options

##### options.refetchQueries

Type: `DocumentNode[]`<br/>
Default: `[]`

List of queries to refetch after mutation succeeds.

##### options.waitForRefetchQueries

Type: `boolean`<br/>
Default: `false`

Determines whether to wait for queries to refetch or complete the mutation immediately.

### MutationResult

`useMutation` hook returns an object consisting of the following fields.

#### mutate

Type: `Function`

Function that triggers a mutation.
Accepts an optional object of variables to pass to mutation.
Returns a promise that resolves when mutation is completed.

```js
const {mutate} = useMutation(CREATE_POST_MUTATION);

const onCreatePost = async () => {
	await mutate({
		title: 'New Post'
	});
};
```

#### data

Type: `object`<br/>
Default: `null`

Data returned from the query.

#### isLoading

Type: `boolean`<br/>
Default: `false`

Indicates whether mutation is currently in-flight.

#### error

Type: `NetworkError | GraphQLError | null`<br/>
Default: `null`

Error returned from the mutation request.
